Besides the *Further Reading* resource specified chapter-wise, be sure to refer to the "special" section below entitled **Generic online and book resources : miscellaneous, very useful**! These
links and books are considered to be useful throughout your journey through this book and after.
<br>

## Generic online and book resources : miscellaneous, very useful

- [The Linux kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/#the-linux-kernel-documentation)

- In general an excellent in-depth technical article: [SO YOU WANT TO BUILD AN EMBEDDED LINUX SYSTEM?, Jay Carlson, Oct 2020](https://jaycarlson.net/embedded-linux/) ; it covers an introduction to the whys
and why-nots of using Linux on an embedded system, hardware and software design workflow, as well as a pretty detailed rundown on 10 CPUs/boards that run embedded Linux (with benchmarks)
- Julia Evans' blog and zines:
    - ['You can be a kernel hacker!', Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/18/you-can-be-a-kernel-hacker/)

- *Tip (reprodcued from Chapter 5)*: 
"Is there a really practical hands-on tip, an almost guaranteed way to become a kernel hacker? Of course, keep reading this book! Ha ha, yes, besides, do partake in the [simply awesome Eudyptula Challenge](http://www.eudyptula-challenge.org/). Hang on, it's - very unfortuantely, and as of this writing - closed down.
Fear not, [here's a site with all the challenges](https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula) posted (and the solutions, don't cheat!); do check it out and try the challenges."
